# Java Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation

## Basic Concept
Java uses a two-step compilation process. First, Java source code is compiled into platform-independent bytecode by the Java compiler (javac). Then, at runtime, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes this bytecode. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a crucial component that improves Java's performance by converting frequently executed bytecode into native machine code.

## How JIT Works

### Initial Execution
1. When a Java application starts, the JVM loads the bytecode
2. Initially, the JVM interprets the bytecode directly
3. During interpretation, the JVM profiles and monitors code execution

### Compilation Process
1. The JVM identifies "hot spots" - code sections that are frequently executed
2. Once a method's execution count exceeds a certain threshold, the JIT compiler is triggered
3. The JIT compiler translates the bytecode into optimized native machine code
4. This native code is stored in a code cache for future use

### Optimization Techniques
- Method inlining: Replacing method calls with the actual method body
- Loop unrolling: Reducing loop overhead by executing multiple iterations in a single pass
- Escape analysis: Determining if objects can be allocated on stack instead of heap
- Dead code elimination: Removing unreachable or unused code
- Constant folding: Computing constant expressions at compile time

## Tiered Compilation
Modern Java uses tiered compilation with multiple levels:
1. Level 0: Interpreter
2. Level 1: C1 compiler (client) - quick compilation, basic optimizations
3. Level 2: Limited C1 with additional profiling
4. Level 3: Full C1 with additional profiling
5. Level 4: C2 compiler (server) - aggressive optimizations

## Benefits
- Improved performance for frequently executed code
- Dynamic optimization based on runtime behavior
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Balance between startup time and peak performance

## Trade-offs
- Initial overhead for compilation
- Memory usage for storing compiled code
- Warm-up time needed for optimal performance
